```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Web3 world!");

    let a = 10;
    let b = 5;

    println!("Addition: {} + {} = {}", a, b, a + b);
    println!("Subtraction: {} - {} = {}", a, b, a - b);
    println!("Multiplication: {} * {} = {}", a, b, a * b);
    println!("Division: {} / {} = {}", a, b, a / b);
}
